*** How to prepare

* Hardware
- You need Arduino Uno (compatible) hardware.
- Connect Vout of VS1838B to digital pin 8 (configurable) and pull-up by
  1k ohm resistor.
- Connect Vcc of VS1838B to 5V and GND of VS1838B to GND.

* Software
You need the AVR toolchain, which is included in Arduino SDK.
Set PATH to the toolchain and type 'make' to compile.
Use avrdude to write the software.


*** How to use

Power-on your Arduino Uno and connect to serial console.
