*** How to prepare

* Hardware
- You need Arduino Uno (compatible) hardware.
- Connect the anode of IrLED to digital pin 3 (configurable).
- Connect the cathode of IrLED to GND.
- Connect HC-SR04's Trig to 9, Echo to 10.


* Software
You need the AVR toolchain, which is included in Arduino SDK.
intervals in ir-send.c must be replaced with the ir-recv result.
Set PATH to the toolchain and type 'make' to compile.
Use avrdude to write the software.


*** How to use

Power-on your Arduino Uno and bring your hand near HC-SR04, then Ir signal
will be sent.
